/* Linked List Theory

- A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes.
- Each node contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
- Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as they do not require shifting of elements like arrays.
- There are several types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- Linked lists are commonly used in scenarios where dynamic memory allocation and frequent modifications are required.


methods commonly associated with linked lists:-
- push(value): Adds a new node with the specified value at the end of the linked list.
- pop(): Removes the last node from the linked list and returns it.
- unshift(value): Adds a new node with the specified value at the beginning of the linked list.
- shift(): Removes the first node from the linked list and returns it.
- get(index): Retrieves the node at the specified index in the linked list.
- set(index, value): Updates the value of the node at the specified index in the linked list.
- insert(index, value): Inserts a new node with the specified value at the specified index in the linked list.
- remove(index): Removes the node at the specified index from the linked list and returns it.
- printList(): Prints all the values in the linked list.
